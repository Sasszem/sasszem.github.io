In this challenge you can have endless fun with MD5.

## Instructions

Are you ready for a friendly MD5 cracking competition? If you are, then take a deep breath and open the web application!

# Writeup

I opened the website, and they wanted a password.
and there were some information:
```
 md5(password + 'ki7') =
 C0082EB33C3EF7745189B611E6C4CC87
 ```

So there was an unknown password, the salt is known, and the MD5 hash is known too.  

**There is a software for cracking hashes (including MD5) called [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/).**
I've downloaded it, checked the manuals, how can I use it.  
As it turns out, it can use my __RTX 3070 Ti__ GPU with **CUDA**.

After giving it the right instructions, it could easily crack the first password.
Then the second, and third.

After 3 passwords, I've realized, there will be 120 passwords. I got bored so I wrote a python script and let it work.  
...  
I could download the hash and salt from a `json` :
```json
{
  "hash": "c0082eb33c3ef7745189b611e6c4cc87",
  "level": 1,
  "salt": "ki7"
}
```

Do some serialization. a weird `while` loop, press **F5** and wait.  
 
 120 passwords later I've got a flag:  
 `n0m0r3h4sh4u`  
  *No more hash for you*
